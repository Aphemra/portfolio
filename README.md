# Portfolio

A portfolio site for me! Outlines my skills and experience, to better inform those that may give me money for bills.

## Getting Started

In the project directory, run these commands to get started:

### 1. `npm install`

This will install all dependencies for the application from npm.

### 2. `npm start`

This will start the development server and open a webpage in your browser automatically to view the application.
